<h2>HCore SysSpawn</h2>

<p class="Files">Files <b>CCore/inc/sys/SysSpawn.h</b> <b>CCore/src/sys/SysSpawn.cpp</b></p>

<p>
<b>HCore</b> target support for the child process spawning includes the following components:
</p>

<h4>SpawnChild</h4>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">SpawnChild</span>
 {
  // public

  struct WaitResult
   {
    int status;
    ErrorType error;
   };

  // private data

  ....

  // public

  ErrorType spawn(char *wdir,char *path,char **argv,char **envp) noexcept; // path!=0 , argv!=0 , envp!=0

  WaitResult wait() noexcept;
 };

</pre>

<p>
This struct is used to spawn a child process. 
Initially it is dirty.
Using the method <b>spawn()</b> on a dirty object you may spawn a new child process.
The first argument is a new working directory for the child process, it may be null.
The second is a path of executable file.
The third is an argument list.
The last is an environment list.
Both lists are terminated with a null pointer.
All strings here are null-terminated.
If the spawn is successful, it makes the object initialized.
You may call the method <b>wait()</b> on such object.
</p>

<p>
<b>wait()</b> waits for the child process completion then returns the process status.
It also makes the object dirty again. Don't call the <b>wait()</b> twice, even in case of error!
</p>

<h4>SpawnWaitList</h4>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">SpawnWaitList</span>
 {
  // public

  struct WaitResult
   {
    void *arg;
    int status;
    ErrorType error;
   };

  // private data

  ....

  // public

  ErrorType init(ulen reserve) noexcept;

  ErrorType exit() noexcept;

  ErrorType add(SpawnChild *spawn,void *arg) noexcept; // makes spawn reusable

  WaitResult wait() noexcept;
 };

</pre>

<p>
This struct implements a process wait list. 
As usual, you have to construct the object using the method <b>init()</b> and destroy it after use by the method <b>exit()</b>.
The argument of the <b>init()</b> reserve a space for the given number of wait slots.
</p>

<p>
<b>add()</b> adds the initialized process with the given opaque data pointer to the wait list.
The spawn struct becomes dirty after this call.
</p>

<p>
<b>wait()</b> waits for the processes, included in the list. 
Once one of them is finished, it returns the process status with the process data pointer.
The process is removed from the list. 
If the wait list is empty, the function does not wait, but returns nulls.
If the <b>arg</b> is not null, it indicates, that the correspondent process is removed from the list,
even if the <b>error</b> is not null.
</p>

<h4>GetShell</h4>

<pre>

StrLen <span class="Att">GetShell</span>(char buf[MaxPathLen+1]) noexcept;

</pre>

<p>
This function returns the system shell path. It may use (or may not) the provided buffer.
</p>

<h4>GetEnviron</h4>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">GetEnviron</span>
 {
  // public

  struct NextResult
   {
    StrLen env;
    ErrorType error;
    bool eof;
   };

  // private data

  ....

  // public

  ErrorType init() noexcept;

  ErrorType exit() noexcept;

  NextResult next() noexcept;
 };

</pre>

<p>
This structure is a cursor over environment record list. Each record is a string of the form <b>"NAME=VALUE"</b>.
To iterate you have to create the object, then use the method <b>next()</b> to get subsequent records.
The <b>NextResult</b> value consists of the string, the error code and the <b>eof</b> flag.
This flag is set if there in no records anymore.
The string is temporary and will be destroyed either by the next call of the <b>next()</b>, or <b>exit()</b>.
