<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> is released without known bugs or defects  (but an intermediate states of the repository between release tags 
MAY be broken). This code is made "as best as possible" and has 
a top quality both in design and implementation. It's a reliable piece of software. 
So if you experience troubles, <b>CCore</b> code is the last place to look for bugs. This does not mean,
naturally, that I do guarantee the code is completely bug-free and absolutely perfect. That is not
achievable in the mean time. And, of course, everybody is welcome to contribute in its perfection: report a 
real problem or suggest a design improvement.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> is a <i>platform</i> mainly for the development of real-time applications. It is distributed under the
<a href="http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt">Boost Software License</a>.
You can use <b>CCore</b> to build host applications also, but without any real-time properties. 
We use the term "host application" to designate an application, running on a host machine.
"Stand-alone application" means an application, running on a stand-alone device. 
<b>CCore</b> is a multi-target platform, you can (and, in fact, must!) develop your own target 
(host or stand-alone) for your specific target device. The installation of <b>CCore</b> provides 
the following targets:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WIN32</b> &mdash; default host target, based on <b>cygwin</b>,</li>
<li><b>WIN64</b> &mdash; host target for <b>cygwin64</b>,</li>
<li><b>LIN64</b> &mdash; host target for 64-bits Linux,</li>
<li><b>BeagleBoneBlack</b> &mdash; stand-alone target for the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">BeagleBone Black</a> device,</li>
<li><b>Vanilla-H</b> &mdash; host target template,</li>
<li><b>Vanilla-X</b> &mdash; stand-alone target template.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Target</b> includes compiler and tools, makefile rules and parts of source code, specific for the target. 
In most cases you are encouraged to develop components of your application using <b>WIN32</b> target (or another host target) and 
then port it to a stand-alone target when it's ready. <b>CCore</b> is designed in target-independent 
and platform-independent manner (despite it's a platform itself!). So it's recommended to follow this
practice. Developing components on a host target is usually simpler and more productive.
</p>
<p>
<b>CCore</b> is implemented using <b>C++17+concepts</b>. It enables the full advantage of this renewed language for the
embedded and real-time software development. You can also use it to build usual host applications. <b>CCore</b> 
is well-suited to develop a wide range of applications like servers, mathematical calculations or file-processing utilities.
The number of them are supplied as supplementary tools.
<b>CCore</b> is based on the comprehensive, type-rich library, well, <b>CCore</b>. That's the core part
of the platform. The next part is <b>HCore</b> for host targets and <b>XCore</b> for stand-alone targets.
On host targets we rely on an operating system to perform some tasks (like primary memory management, 
task synchronization etc.). So a host target provides a tiny layer between <b>HCore</b> and OS system calls.
But on a stand-alone target we implements these fundamental functions ourself. <b>XCore</b> is an 
implementation of this part for <span class="Alert">single-core</span> CPUs. A target provides an implementation of very low-level 
CPU specific functions <b>XCore</b> is based on. For example, the following 3 functions are required for 
interrupt lock support:
</p>

<pre>

/* functions */ 

bool <span class="Alert">IsIntContext()</span> noexcept;

/* classes */ 

class IntLock;

/* class IntLock */ 

class IntLock : NoCopy
 {
   bool enable;

  public:

   IntLock() { enable=Internal::Disable(); }
 
   ~IntLock() { if( enable ) Internal::Enable(); }
   
   struct Internal
    {
     static bool <span class="Alert">Disable()</span> noexcept;
     
     static void <span class="Alert">Enable()</span> noexcept;
    };
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> is designed as a <span class="Alert">compliant</span> <b>C++17+concepts</b> library. There are a few places where we are using non-standard 
language extensions. In fact, we need only two of them: <b>restrict</b> and initialization priority
attributes for static objects, supported in <b>gcc</b> family of compilers. As the result, there is no restriction
on the compiler optimization level, unlike other OS cores. Another advantage is the platform-independence of the code. 
</p>

<h2>CCore</h2>

<p>

<b>CCore</b> is a language support library. It's created to provide an improved language support 
for C++ and to replace the error-prone and obsolete "old bad" C RTL and STL. <b>CCore</b> is focused on the
"everyday programmer's needs", it tries to be small, but powerful.

</p>
<p>

In particular, it contains:

</p>

<ol>
<li><b>PtrLen</b> and <b>Range</b> for convenient and efficient ranges and loops,</li>
<li><b>Printf</b> with class print support, easily customized output devices and options,</li>
<li><b>Function</b> for efficient callback support,</li>
<li>Mersenne Twister random number generator,</li>
<li>Radix-tree based <b>heap</b> with real-time properties,</li>
<li>Swap-based intro-sort,</li>
<li><b>Cmp/Move/Swap</b> support,</li>
<li>Error-handling infrastructure to support multi-error handling,</li>
<li>Any kind of <b>lists</b>,</li>
<li>Radix and Red-Black <b>trees</b>,</li>
<li>Properly implemented dynamic <b>arrays</b> (bye-bye STL),</li>
<li><b>Packet</b>, an async processing infrastructure, a key foundation for a system layer and server applications,</li>
<li><b>Integer</b> library, you may even calculate 1000000 digits of &pi;,</li>
<li><b>Crypton</b> library,</li> 
<li>Fast log and event recorder,</li>
<li>New network infrastructure, based on <b>PTP</b> protocol,</li>
<li><b>DDL(data-definition language)</b> implementation,</li>
<li>and many other helpful tools.</li>
</ol>

<h2>XCore</h2>

<p>

<b>XCore</b> is a multi-task core for embedded systems. It is combined with <b>CCore</b> library. 
The core is designed for single-core CPU systems. 

</p>
<p>

<b>XCore</b>:

</p>

<ol>
<li>provides a rich set of synchronization objects and a simple way to construct additional ones,</li> 
<li>implements priority inheritance and deadlock detection for mutexes,</li> 
<li>task scheduler switches on high frequency (10 kHz for <b>BeagleBoneBlack</b> platform),
      that provides fine-grained task execution, ensure the system is highly responsive,</li>
<li>scheduler supports task priority relaxation, that protects low priority tasks 
      from complete execution hold-on,</li> 
<li>full support for C++17,</li>
<li>no limitation for compiler optimization level,</li> 
<li>clear target requirements.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Task synchronization</h2>

<p>
One of the innovation in <b>CCore</b> is the set of task synchronization objects. <b>Mutex</b>, <b>Event</b> 
and <b>Sem</b>(aphore) are common.
But we widely use also: <b>AntiSem</b>, <b>ResSem</b>, <b>MultiSem</b>, <b>MultiEvent</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>AntiSem</b> is useful for the resource control:
</p>

<pre>

class AntiSem : public Funchor_nocopy
 {
   ....

  public:
   
   // constructors
  
   explicit AntiSem(ulen level=0);
   
   explicit AntiSem(TextLabel name,ulen level=0);
   
   ~AntiSem();
   
   // add/sub
   
   void add(ulen dcount);
   
   void sub(ulen dcount);
   
   // inc/dec
   
   void inc() { add(1); }
   
   void dec() { sub(1); }
   
   // wait
   
   bool try_wait();
   
   void wait();
   
   bool wait(MSec timeout);
   
   bool wait(TimeScope time_scope);
    
   // functions
   
   Function&lt;void (void)&gt; function_inc();
   
   Function&lt;void (void)&gt; function_dec();
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>AntiSem</b> waits until "all taken is released". I.e. until the internal counter falls below a given level (usually 0).
</p>

<p>
<b>ResSem</b> is used to control a resource allocation. It is combined <b>Sem</b> and <b>AntiSem</b>.
</p>

<pre>

class ResSem : public Funchor_nocopy
 {
  public:
   
   // constructors
  
   explicit ResSem(ulen max_count);
   
   ResSem(TextLabel name,ulen max_count);
   
   ~ResSem();
   
   // give
   
   void give();
   
   // take
  
   bool try_take();
  
   void take();
  
   bool take(MSec timeout);
  
   bool take(TimeScope time_scope);
   
   // wait
   
   bool try_wait();
   
   void wait();
  
   bool wait(MSec timeout);
   
   bool wait(TimeScope time_scope);
   
   // functions
   
   Function&lt;void (void)&gt; function_give();
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>ResSem</b> has the internal counter between 0 and the given <b>max_count</b> (initial value). You can <b>take</b> and <b>give</b> it back. 
<b>take</b> may wait if the counter is zero. Finally, <b>wait</b> waits until the counter reaches <b>max_count</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>MultiSem</b> and <b>MultiEvent</b> are "multi-channel" versions of the <b>Sem</b> and <b>Event</b>. They can wait for one 
of the several events. They also ensure the "fairness" in the event reporting.
</p>

<pre>

template &lt;ulen Len&gt;
class MultiEvent : public Funchor_nocopy
 {
  public:

   // constructors
  
   MultiEvent();
   
   explicit MultiEvent(TextLabel name);
   
   ~MultiEvent();

   // trigger
  
   bool trigger(ulen index); // [1,Len]
   
   // wait
   
   ulen try_wait(); // [0,Len]
   
   ulen wait(); // [1,Len]
   
   ulen wait(MSec timeout); // [0,Len]
   
   ulen wait(TimeScope time_scope); // [0,Len]
   
   // functions
   
   template &lt;ulen Index&gt;
   Function&lt;void (void)&gt; function_trigger();
 };
 
template &lt;ulen Len&gt; 
class MultiSem : public Funchor_nocopy
 {
  public:
  
   // constructors

   MultiSem();
   
   explicit MultiSem(TextLabel name);
   
   ~MultiSem();

   // give
  
   void give(ulen index); // [1,Len]
   
   // take
   
   ulen try_take(); // [0,Len]
   
   ulen take(); // [1,Len]
   
   ulen take(MSec timeout); // [0,Len]
   
   ulen take(TimeScope time_scope); // [0,Len]
   
   // functions
   
   template &lt;ulen Index&gt;
   Function&lt;void (void)&gt; function_give();
 };
 
</pre>

<p>
All synchronization classes "publish" "giving" functions callbacks.
</p>

<h2>Packet</h2>

<p>
<b>Packet</b> is a micro-task. It has the associated small stack to store call parameters and return values. 
A larger data buffer may be also attached.
<b>Packet</b>s allow design of a request processing systems as a collection of packet-processing devices. <b>Packet</b>s are initiated 
by some initiator and passed to the processing device. It may pass a packet further until it's completed or cancelled by 
the initiator. Initiator assigns a completion function for a packet. So when packet is completed it goes to this function, where
result can be extracted and packet is disposed. Also a completion signaling is performed there.
</p>

<h2>Lists, trees, arrays</h2>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> includes implementations of lists, trees, and arrays. 
</p>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> lists and trees are intrusive (non-intrusive containers are also provided). Intrusive linked containers have the following advantages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>they are more suitable for applications,</li>
<li>they efficient, no memory allocation and error conditions for container operations,</li>
<li>you may include one object in the several containers,</li>
<li>you may build a non-intrusive container based on intrusive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> implements wide range of lists, both single linked and double linked, linear and circular.
</p>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> implements radix and red-black trees. 
</p>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> provides implementation for dynamic arrays. 
</p>

<h2>PTP</h2>

<p>
<b>PTP</b> &mdash; packet transaction protocol. It supersedes TCP as a main network protocol for client-server
applications. PTP is a packet-based, parallel and transactional protocol. It is simple and convenient
for the development of "remote call" type interactions. Parallel nature of PTP makes obsolete such tricks
as multi-thread FTP download. PTP is working atop a packet point-to-point or point-to-multipoint
service like UDP (or even raw Ethernet). PTP has ability to adapt for smaller MTU lengths, 
that is important to combine with another network protocols, which can reduce MTU (for example, 
to implement encapsulation or encryption). 
</p>

<p>
There are several typical problems when network interaction is developed based on TCP:
</p>

<ul>
<li>you have to parse a continuous byte stream on packets,</li>
<li>you cannot perform parallel transactions, so if TCP is stalled on a packet loss, 
then everything is stalled,</li>
<li>you have to match calls with responses yourself, using sequence numbers, for example.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>PTP</b> resolves all these issues.</p>

<p>
<b>PTPServer</b> &mdash; a PTP server on a host machine, it provides access to the host file system
via <b>HFS</b> over <b>PTP</b> protocols.
</p>

<h2>DDL</h2>

<p>
<b>DDL</b> &mdash; data definition language. It is designed to represent an abstract 
linked data in a textual form. <b>DDL</b> has a C-style syntax.
Here is a short example of a parser state machine representation, expressed in <b>DDL</b>:
</p>

<pre>

struct State
 {
  StateIndex state;

  struct Transition { NTIndex ntt; State *state; } [] transitions;

  struct Final { TIndex t; Rule *rule; } [] finals;
 };

State[22] StateTable=
 {
  { 0 ,
   {
    { 1 , StateTable+1 },
    { 5 , StateTable+2 },
    { 6 , StateTable+3 },
    { 7 , StateTable+4 },
    { 8 , StateTable+16 }
   },
   {
    { 1 , RuleTable+0 },
    { 5 , RuleTable+0 }
   }
  },

....

</pre>

<p>
<b>DDL</b> can be used for a manually introduced data, like configuration information.
Or it can be used to store a program-generated data to exchange with different data-processing programs.
</p>

<h2>LR1 parser generator</h2>

<p>
<a href="page_CondLangLR1.html"><b>CondLangLR1</b></a> is a tool for generation LR1 parser state machines. It takes a language description and produces
a <b>.ddl</b> file with a state machine description. You can use this description further to generate code 
in any suitable for your purpose form. 
<a type="application/pdf" href="../doc/Conditional recursive grammars.pdf">Conditional recursive grammars</a> are used to describe a language.
</p>

<h2>Regen</h2>

<p>
<a href="page_Regen.html"><b>Regen</b></a> is a tool for generating helper classes and constants from a register description.
It is used to simplify and beautify the low-level register device programming.
