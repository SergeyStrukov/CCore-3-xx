<h1>CCore installation</h1>

<h2>Cook book (updated according the latest cygwin and CCore-3.00 development)</h2>

<p>

In order to use <b>CCore</b>, you have to "cook" it.

The following ingredients are required:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse (optional)</a>,</li>
<li><b>CCore</b> package (or repository).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Install <b>cygwin</b> first. Include <b>make</b>, <b>bash</b> and <b>g++</b> in your installation.
If you are not familiar with this platform, spend some time to learn it.
To work with the current version of <b>CCore</b> <b>gcc-7.1.0</b> is required.
</p>
<p>

Create the directory <b>bin</b> in your <b>cygwin home</b> directory. <b>CCore</b> uses some tools and utilities,
they are built in and invoked from this directory. Make sure this directory is included into the <b>cygwin path</b>.
You can also include this directory into the <b>Windows path</b>.

</p>
<p>

Unpack <b>CCore</b> package (or checkout the source tree from a repository) somewhere under you <b>cygwin home</b> directory. <span class="Hint">Avoid file and directory names with space characters.</span>

</p>
<p>

Open <b>bash</b> console (or another console you would prefer, just configure it to use <b>cygwin bash</b> as a command processor).<br /><br />
Go to the <b>CCore root</b> directory. The following commands are used to prepare, clean and build the whole installation:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="Cmd">make</span> &mdash; to build all,</li>
<li><span class="Cmd">make clean</span> &mdash; to clean,</li>
<li><span class="Cmd">make list</span> &mdash; to build source file lists; you will need this command if you alter source file set,
<span class="Alert">before using it you have, however, to build <b>CCore</b> tools</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Post-install notes</h2>

<p>
You may need to update the file <b>Makefile.tools</b> in your host Target directory to select the proper compiler and other tools.
</p>

<p>
Once you install and build <b>CCore</b>, tools are built in the <b>~/bin</b> directory.
Two of them: <b>CCore-MakeList.exe</b> and <b>CCore-Regen.exe</b>, are the essential part of the build process, <span class="Alert">so keep them in the working condition</span>.
</p>

<p>
<b>cygwin</b> terminal has a limitation in its console functions. It cannot be used to run some tools 
and tests. You can use the following <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/">console program</a> instead to avoid troubles.
</p>

<p>
You can use <b>Eclipse</b> as an <b>IDE</b> to work with <b>CCore</b> and <b>CCore</b>-based projects. <b>CCore</b> package includes
the archive <b>eclipse-Mars.7z</b> with the <b>Eclipse Mars</b> workbench. 
You will need <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html">Anonymouse Pro</a> 
font for the text editor. Before using this workbench you have to adjust some settings.
</p>

<p>
Open menu <b>Window/Preferences...</b> . Then open the <b>C++/Build/Environment</b> tab. 
Correct variables <b>CYGWIN</b> and <b>CYGWIN64</b> to point to <b>cygwin</b> and <b>cygwin64</b> installation directories.
</p>

<a name="WIN64"><h2>WIN64</h2></a>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> supports the 64-bits Windows development using <b>cygwin64</b>. The host target <b>WIN64</b> is provided.
</p>

<p>
Place <b>CCore</b> at a desired directory. You need <b>/bin</b> subdirectory 
in your home directory for tools, it must be included in the <b>cygwin64</b> search path. 
You have to edit the file <b>Makefile.host</b>:
change it from 
</p>

<pre>

CCORE_TARGET = WIN32

</pre>

<p>
to
</p>

<pre>

CCORE_TARGET = WIN64

</pre>

<h2>LIN64</h2>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> supports the 64-bits Linux development. The host target <b>LIN64</b> is provided.
This target is developed based on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 13.04</a> (running on the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>),
but should be fine on others 64-bits Linux platforms.
</p>

<p>
To deploy <b>CCore</b> on Linux, you need to install some additional developers components.
</p>

<p>
First, you need <b>gcc-7.1.0</b> or later. 
</p>

<p>
Second, you need the library <b>libaio</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, you need the library <b>libgmp</b>. 
</p>

<p>
On <b>Ubuntu</b> you may use the following command to install additional packages:
</p>

<pre>

sudo apt-get install &lt;package-name&gt;

</pre>

<p>
The packages you need are: <b>g++</b>, <b>libaio-dev</b>, <b>libgmp-dev</b> (double check with the system support).
</p>

<p>
Once you have installed required packages, place <b>CCore</b> at a desired directory. You need <b>/bin</b> subdirectory 
in your home directory for tools, it must be included in the search path. You have to edit the file <b>Makefile.host</b>:
change it from 
</p>

<pre>

CCORE_TARGET = WIN32

</pre>

<p>
to
</p>

<pre>

CCORE_TARGET = LIN64

</pre>

<p>
To run on the <b>VirtualBox</b> hack the source code at the file <b>IntelCPUID.s</b> (<b>Target/LIN64/CCore/src/crypton</b>).
Uncomment the following line to get the hardware AES support.
</p>

<pre>

#        orl     $0x42000000, %ecx

</pre>

<h2>BeagleBoneBlack</h2>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> includes the primary <b>XCore</b> target <b>BeagleBoneBlack</b>. You can use this target
to build applications running on the popular 
board <a href="http://beagleboard.org/black">BeagleBone Black</a>.
Read <a type="application/pdf" href="../doc/BeagleBoneBlack.pdf">this document</a> to learn more about this target.
